2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell top_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/Use_BSCAN.FDC_I/Use_UART.execute_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) top_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/Use_UART.execute_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell top_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) top_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RST relative to clock(s) CLK_clk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/INTERNAL_TCK (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#2 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE (see constraint position 8 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#3 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/INTERNAL_TCK and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#4 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/INTERNAL_TCK and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#5 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK (see constraint position 8 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#6 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A Clock Group timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and top_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/INTERNAL_TCK (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).
